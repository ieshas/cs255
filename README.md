**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

DriverPass was a client that aimed to lower the failed driving test rate at the DMV by providing online classes, practice tests and on-the-road training for users who are yearning for their driver’s license.

**What did you do particularly well?**

I'm proud of my activity diagrams. I felt they were easy to follow and neat. I also think I went into enough detail to cover some questions that might arise if someone was to look at it.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

My use case diagram is weak. I struggled on it both in module 6, and revising it for project 2. If I were to go back again I would start from scratch, maybe start on pen and paper to get every possible connection out. I spent a lot of time looking at a blank LucidChart screen.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

Going off of the interview, I created diagrams that would fuffill both the client and user needs. Considering the user's needs is essential because they are the ones interacting with your product. To get and keep customers, you have to keep them postive. With a customer in mind, you're not blindly designing. Instead you're designing with a purpose and trying to solve the problems of that user.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

Iterative design approach is actually very useful. I believe improving as you go creates a better end product because doing everything at once can create burnout, errors, and bad design. Passing over it again and again, or moving on and coming back to it is beneficial to me and something I will be implementing from now on.
